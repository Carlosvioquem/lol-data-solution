# MAD Lions E.C. LoL Team Manager
These days, professional teams have the need to manage the data they generate every day in scrims, solo queue and official matches. There is not only the need of maintaining the post game data but also pre game data and the tools available in the market are too expensive for what they offer, even for top tier teams. 

LoL Team Manager aims to provide everything a team might need from competition, solo queue and scrim data management to a ML assisted drafting tool.
